Did you ever find a 1978 quarter with a hole in it outside the Walmart outside of town in the parking lot next to the handicap parking spots and you tried to use it in the soda machine but the machine rejected it and then your classmate who you fancy walked by into the store and you waved at them but they didn’t see you so you went home and put on your favorite album while you drew a character from one of your favorite tv shows but you just can’t seem to get their eyes drawn right so you put away your drawing stuff for the evening and turn on the tv but immediately decide against it and then pull out your guitar and noodle on the strings for a little bit and then brush your teeth and go to bed
