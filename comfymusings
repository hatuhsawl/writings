~ lying under the blanket of stars in an uncovered, new moon night sky, feeling the soul-crushing and soul-freeing weight of uselessness of insignificance that can only be felt by beholding the vast, unknowable expanses of the universe from our tiny water drop of a planet's view of the cosmos, and feeling that insignificance in the arms of a lover whose also there, beholding it all with me

~ riding on a motorcycle on a warm, twilit street, full view of the city across the bay, your loved one on the seat behind you, the purr of the machine below you, the warmth of your lovers arms around your chest, their chest pressed into your back as you two ride parallel to the sunset

~ sailing on a small ship on the open water, feeling the warm salty air splashing on your face, enjoying the view of the seas and your lover sitting at the edge of the boat in a bathing suit, while you hear the wind whistling through your sails and the sporadic screams of the gulls, the water lapping meditatively against the boat as you cut through the water

~ sitting on a hill top above a wheat field on a warm summer day, quietly watching the wind dance and play through the wheat stalks like a will-o-the-wisp, looking over at your lover, their face hidden under a wide brimmed hat but the rest of their skin glowing in the warm summer sun
