2:34 AM

We’re lying in bed. I can’t sleep, so I’m doomscrolling and decide to watch Scott the Woz

You’re sleeping next to me. I look over at you, in the glow from the moon coming through the window I see your beautiful face. It scrunches, as if you’re puzzled, only briefly. Something stumping you in your dream perhaps. 

You figure whatever it was out, because your face unscrunches. I see a smile start at the corner of your mouth as my eyes look elsewhere. They land on your long black hair, which flows from the top of your head and drapes lazily over your shoulder and breasts.

I let my eyes keep going and trace your curves in the moonlight until the blanket starts, leaving the rest of you to my imagination as the bedding hides everything else. 

You’re always so cold, always asking me for my jacket or to come closer to me. I wonder sometimes if you leave yours at home so you have an excuse to wear mine. 

My eyes wander upward from the bed into the hallway
