I got stood up by a sweet gal outside Lake Okeechobee in 1976. I stood there waiting for her, and I even got her favorite, Coke and Peanuts, but she never showed. 

Her parents say she died in a car wreck, but I know what they didn’t want anybody to know. I knew she had another lover, but I was hoping she didn’t. 

I hope her wife makes her happy like I couldn’t, and gets her Coke and peanuts
